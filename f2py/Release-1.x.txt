I am pleased to announce the first public release of f2py 1.116:

Writing Python C/API wrappers for Fortran routines can be a very
tedious task, especially if a Fortran routine takes more than 20
arguments but only few of them are relevant for the problems that they
solve.

The Fortran to Python Interface Generator, or FPIG for short, is a
command line tool (f2py) for generating Python C/API modules for
wrapping Fortran 77 routines, accessing common blocks from Python, and
calling Python functions from Fortran (call-backs).

The tool can be downloaded from

    http://cens.ioc.ee/projects/f2py2e/

where you can find also information about f2py features and its User's
Guide.

f2py is released under the LGPL license.

With regards,
     Pearu Peterson <pearu@ioc.ee>
