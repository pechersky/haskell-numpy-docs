# Setting using array is hard because
#  The parser doesn't stop at tuples always
#  So, the setitem code will be called with scalars on the
#  wrong shaped array.
# But we can get a view as an ndarray of the given type:
g = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]).view(ff.floatint_type)

# Now, the elements will be the scalar type associated
#  with the ndarray.
print(g[0])
print(type(g[1]))

# Now, you need to register ufuncs and more arrfuncs to do useful things...
