NumPy Enhancement Proposals
===========================

NumPy Enhancement Proposals (NEPs) describe proposed changes to NumPy.
NEPs are modeled on Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs), and are typically
written up when large changes to NumPy are proposed.

This page provides an overview of all NEPs, making only a distinction between
the ones that have been implemented and those that have not been implemented.
