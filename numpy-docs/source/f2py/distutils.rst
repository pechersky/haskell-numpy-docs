Using via `numpy.distutils`
=============================

:mod:`numpy.distutils` is part of NumPy extending standard Python ``distutils``
to deal with Fortran sources and F2PY signature files, e.g. compile Fortran
sources, call F2PY to construct extension modules, etc.

.. topic:: Example

  Consider the following `setup file`__:

  .. include:: setup_example.py
    :literal:

  Running

  ::

    python setup_example.py build

  will build two extension modules ``scalar`` and ``fib2`` to the
  build directory.

  __ setup_example.py

:mod:`numpy.distutils` extends ``distutils`` with the following features:

* ``Extension`` class argument ``sources`` may contain Fortran source
  files. In addition, the list ``sources`` may contain at most one
  F2PY signature file, and then the name of an Extension module must
  match with the ``<modulename>`` used in signature file.  It is
  assumed that an F2PY signature file contains exactly one ``python
  module`` block.

  If ``sources`` does not contain a signature files, then F2PY is used
  to scan Fortran source files for routine signatures to construct the
  wrappers to Fortran codes.

  Additional options to F2PY process can be given using ``Extension``
  class argument ``f2py_options``.

* The following new ``distutils`` commands are defined:

  ``build_src``
    to construct Fortran wrapper extension modules, among many other things.
  ``config_fc``
    to change Fortran compiler options

  as well as ``build_ext`` and  ``build_clib`` commands are enhanced
  to support Fortran sources.

  Run

  ::

    python <setup.py file> config_fc build_src build_ext --help

  to see available options for these commands.

* When building Python packages containing Fortran sources, then one
  can choose different Fortran compilers by using ``build_ext``
  command option ``--fcompiler=<Vendor>``. Here ``<Vendor>`` can be one of the
  following names::

    absoft sun mips intel intelv intele intelev nag compaq compaqv gnu vast pg hpux

  See ``numpy_distutils/fcompiler.py`` for up-to-date list of
  supported compilers or run

  ::

     f2py -c --help-fcompiler
