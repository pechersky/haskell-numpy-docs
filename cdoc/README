cdoc
====

This is a simple Doxygen project for building NumPy C code documentation,
with docstrings extracted from the C sources themselves.

The understood syntax for documentation in the C source is

    /*
     * Some text in reStructuredText format
     */
    int function_to_which_the_text_applies() 
    {
        ...
    }

    /*
     * More text in reStructuredText format
     */
    struct
    {
        int variable_1; /* Documentation for variable_1 */

        /*
         * Documentation for variable_2
         */
        int variable_2;
    } struct_name_t;

Please do not use JavaDoc or Doxygen-specific formatting at the moment.
