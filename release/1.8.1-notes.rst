Changes
=======

NDIter
~~~~~~
When ``NpyIter_RemoveAxis`` is now called, the iterator range will be reset.

When a multi index is being tracked and an iterator is not buffered, it is
possible to use ``NpyIter_RemoveAxis``. In this case an iterator can shrink
in size. Because the total size of an iterator is limited, the iterator
may be too large before these calls. In this case its size will be set to ``-1``
and an error issued not at construction time but when removing the multi
index, setting the iterator range, or getting the next function.

This has no effect on currently working code, but highlights the necessity
of checking for an error return if these conditions can occur. In most
cases the arrays being iterated are as large as the iterator so that such
a problem cannot occur.

Optional reduced verbosity for np.distutils
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Set ``numpy.distutils.system_info.system_info.verbosity = 0`` and then
calls to ``numpy.distutils.system_info.get_info('blas_opt')`` will not
print anything on the output. This is mostly for other packages using
numpy.distutils.

Deprecations
============

C-API
~~~~~

The utility function npy_PyFile_Dup and npy_PyFile_DupClose are broken by the
internal buffering python 3 applies to its file objects.
To fix this two new functions npy_PyFile_Dup2 and npy_PyFile_DupClose2 are
declared in npy_3kcompat.h and the old functions are deprecated.
Due to the fragile nature of these functions it is recommended to instead use
the python API when possible.
